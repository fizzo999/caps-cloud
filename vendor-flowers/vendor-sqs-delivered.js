// Vendors:

// Vendors should separately subscribe to their personal SQS queue and periodically poll the queue to see delivery notifications

// Connect it to their own vendor queue by using itâ€™s URL/ARN
// As drivers deliver, this app will continually poll the queue, retrieve them, and log details out to the console
// You should be able to disconnect this app, and see deliveries that happened while the app was not running

// ?????? so how does this work if I use the SQS-consumer module - it is like a server that once it is started HANGS like a server listening to more messages - therefore cannot send - YES IT IS !!!
